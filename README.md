# Taxi Driver 2.0
Similar to the basic taxi driver reinforcement learning problem.

However, I enabled the car to turn left and right within and tile and only allow the car to drive forward.

The goal of the environment is to pick up at the P and dropoff at the D. As soon as that is completed, you win and a new round is started.
